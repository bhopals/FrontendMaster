Why Functional Programming (FP)
- Imperative v/s Declarative 
- Functional Programming by it's nature more DECLARATIVE
- Functiona Programming Shift the Focus of our code towards the declarative way from the Imperative
- Functional Programming is Compelling (Powerful)
- A more Pragmatic way of Coding


Procedure
- A Procedure is a collection of Operations, Collection of Things that you need to do in a Program
- A Procedure is a SEQUENCE of Instructions 
- Any Function that does not have a "return" statement (returning Undefined is okay), these are not function, they are procedures


Function
- A Function is a relationship between the input and the output. 
  There is a SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIP Between what I Put In and What I Get Out
- There should be an Obvious Relationship between the INPUT and OUTPUT. 
- And If that is not happening then you are not really accomplishing the spirit of FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
- A Function is a SEMANTIC Relationship between Input and Computed Output, and so DOES The NAMING CONVENTION USED
- Such as Name of the Function, Params naming, Input, Output of the Function, Local Varible Naming - All Matters


Side Effects
- If Function has Side Effects, it is not a TRUE Function.
- The INPUT should be direct (via Param) not External Variable else it is not Function
- Function should have Direct INPUTS and Direct OUTPUTS
- A Function Call within Function creates Side Effect (console.log, print, N/W call, DOM, DataBase Operations)
- A Function Should have a Single Responsibility
- Acceptable Side Effects (Avoid if you can)
  - I/O
  - Database Storage
  - DOM
  - N/W Calls
  - Timestamps
- So MINIMIZE Side Effects
- Avoid Them whenever Possible, otherwise MAKE them Obvious


Pure Function
- A Function that takes all of its INPUT as DIRECT, all of its OUTPUT as Direct, and Its has NO SIDE-EFFECT / POLLUTION.
  SAME INPUT - SAME OUTPUT - Is a Pure Function
- In terms of EXTERNAL Var. Usage, CONSTANTS are allowed. 
  Still a Function would be PURE if it uses that along with DIRECT INPUTS.
- To Achieve Strong Immutability and Function Purity - 
  DON'T Ever Mutate any Object in the Function, Always use a copy of that object
- Should enable Referential Transparency - which means that a function call can be replaced 
      with its computed value without affecting the program’s behavior.

Reducing Surface Area
- Increasing the Readibility, Increasing the Confidence
- Extract the IMPURITY of a Function to make it Pure Function and to avoid any Side Effect / Pollution
- Reduce the Surface Area of the IMPURITY, if its unavoidable - Minimize the Side Effect / Pollution
- That way we are Reducing the Surface Area, and Increasing the Readability and Confidence


Function Arguements
- Arguments are the Parameters that Function Receives
- UNARY  - Single Input Param - Single Return
- BINARY - Two Input Params - Single Return
- ENARY  - More than Two Input Params - Single Return


Function Arguments Shape Adapter
- HOF - High Order Function
- A Function Which EITHER Receive One or more Functions, AND/OR return one or more Function 
- Means the Values Going in OR Coming OUT ANY/BOTH are Function called HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION
- Example: Lodash has many High Order Functions
- A Function that Does not Receive Functions or Returns a Function called SINGLE ORDER FUNCTION


Point Free
- Point-free Style is a way of Defining functions with a very Simple Constrainst: 
  Funciton Defination does not include arguments 
  Tacit programming (point-free programming) is a programming paradigm in which a function definition does not include information regarding its arguments, using combinators and function composition [...] instead of variables.
- Point free style means that the code doesn't explicitly mention it's arguments, even though they exist and are being used.
- Example  const upper = (string) => string.toUpperCase(); ['Apple', 'Banana'].map(upper);
- This is a Concept from Haskell Language - Internally it uses Function Composition
- It Helps to Achieve Right Level Of Abstraction
- Equational Reasoning - It means Reason about one Thing and say it is Equational - In sense of Shape of the Input and Functionality
- isEven == not(isOdd); function not(fn) { return function negated(...args) { return !fn(...args)}}
- Use of Equation Reasoning and Composition to achieve Point Free Approach
- Point Free Style - More Declarative - Be achieved using Equational Reasoing 

Composition
- Output of Fn1 is passed directly to Fn2. The concept of having one Function call Output Immediately becomes the Input of another function is called Composition
- var isOdd = compose(eq(1), mod(2))
- Can be achived using 2 ways:
  - compose - Returns a composed function from the inputs which executes right to left (as displayed in the example above).
    const compose = (...fns) => arg =>
    [...fns].reverse().reduce((result, fn) => fn(result), arg);

    const add1 = num => num + 1;
    const mul2 = num => num * 2;

    const addAndMultiply = compose(
      mul2,
      add1,
    ); // right to left order

    console.log(addAndMultiply(2)); // 6 - first add1 then mul2


  - pipe - Pipe is similar to compose but follows a more natural order of left to right invocation of composed functions.
    const pipe = (...fns) => arg =>
	  [...fns].reduce((result, fn) => fn(result), arg);

    const add1 = num => num + 1;
    const mul2 = num => num * 2;

    const multiplyAndAdd = pipe(
      mul2,
      add1,
    ); // left to right order

    console.log(multiplyAndAdd(2)); // 5 - first mul2 then add1

Closure 
- Closure is when a Function Remember the Variables around it even when that Function is Executed Else Where
- When you are using Closure in Functional Programming you have to make sure you are closing over non-changing, non-mutating values
- As soon as you start mutating values that you closed over, you lose your function purity

Lazy v/s Eager Execution(In Closure)
- Lazy  - Deffering the actual work at the actual call, so if the function executed 5 times, the execution will be called 5 times
- Eager - Execution the function work at the time of defining, returning the result everytime function is called (Expesive computation work will be executed only once) 


Memoization
- In both of the above scenarios (Lazy and Eager), Closure enable us a choice of where we put the code to decide whether we want it to happen Eagerly now OR Lazily later
- The Problem is that it is a trade off.
- However, Is the code written using Eager/Lazy style Closure Functionally PURE? It's NOT
- Functional Programming Says, Don't Close over Something which Changes or Reassigned
- Also, We are breaking the RULE, there is no DECLARATIVE Style
- So If we want a Pure Function, give the Same Input produces the same Output, and You want to CACHE the Result, 
  use MEMOIZATION
- Only use Memoization, if You expect the Function to be called Multiple Times with the Same Input
- However, it is not recommended if it is Other way around, distinct Inputs, becuase It takes Memory


Referential Transparency
- A Function call is Pure if it has Referential Transparency
- It means, A Funtional Call can be replaced with it's return value and not effect any of the rest of the Program
- Referential Transparency is a key Characteristic of the language and the compiler
- And Because of the Guarantee of the Language/Pure Function, the Compiler can take advantage of that
- It Literally normalize everything
- Replacing Function call/Expression with one OUTPUT/RETURNED value as it is Surly going to be the same
- In a same way it does Provide a Readibility to the USERS


Example:
function renderCustomers(customers){...}
function ajax(url, data, cb){ ajax(CUSOMER_API, {id:42}, renderCustomers)}


Generalized to Specialized
- A Cleaner and Readable Approach
- function ajax(url, data, cb){...}; INSTEAD, function getCustomer(data, cb){...ajax(customer, .., ..)}
- Function Params Oder = Generalized ===> Specialized
- BENEFITS
  - Semantics Function Names
  - Better Readibility
  - Make Code More Semantic
  - Self Descriptive Functions
  - Clear Naming Convention / Better Readibility
- To Achieve that we have TWO Technics - PARTIAL APPLICATION and CURRYING


Partial Application (partial)
- It is one Way/Technic of Achieving SPECIALIZATION
- It Takes a FUNCTION as it's FIRST ARGUMENT/INPUT, and then it takes it's next Inputs as a Set of Arguments to pass along to that Function at some Point
- The FIRST ARG will always be A FUNCTION
- A style like Preseting those arguments
- Exampe Code Snippet:  const getCustomer = partial(ajax, CUSTOMER_API); const getCurrUser = partial(getCustomer, {id: 42}); getCurrUser(renderCustomers)
- Partial Application is a Process of Applying a Function to some of Its Arguments. The Partial Applied function returned for Later Use
- In other Words, it is a Function that takes Multiple Parameters and returns a Function with Fewer parameters
- An Utility to PRESET one or more inputs and produce a Function which is expection all rest of the INPUTS
- Partially applying some of the Inputs now, and receiving all the remaining Inputs Later(DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)


Currying
- Curry does not call a Function, it just Transform it
- More Popular and widely used than Partial APP
- A More Common Form of SPECIALIZATION
- Pass an INPUT and get SPECIALIZED function, pass another INPUT and get more SPECIALIZED function, and so on...
- The Curry Name comes from Haskell, a functional programming language, Co-Inventor - Haskell Curry
- All Functions are UNARY in HASKELL
- Currying Always Return another Function with ONLY one Arguement until all of the arguments have been applied
- So we JUST keep calling the returned Function until we have exhausted all the arguments and the final value gets RETURNED
- Currying is a Transform that makes f(a, b, c) callable as f(a)(b)(c)
- Curry takes a Binary/Enary function and returns a Unary function that returns a Unary function
- Currying is a technic of Converting Function Call with N Arguements into chains of N function calls with a Single Arg. for Each Function Call
- A Curried Function have a Built-in Iterator Behaviour. One Arg. is applied at once which is then returned to the calling function to be used for Next Step
- Curry is a Function that takes a Function with Multiple params as Inputs and Returns a Function with Exactly one Param
- By Default, all the methods in Functional Programming are CURRIED. Because it turns out, functional programmers want everything to be Curried
- Curried Function is a chain series of UNITARY FUNCTIONS


Curry Example: 
function log(date, importance, message) { console.log(...)}
const log = _.curry(log)
//ALL SAME
log(new Date(), 'DEBUG', 'Hi There')
log(new Date(), 'DEBUG')('Hi There')
log(new Date())('DEBUG')('Hi There')
var ajax = url => data => callback = {}


Partial APP v/s Currying
- BOTH are Specialization Technic
- Partial App PRESETS some arg. now and receive the rest on the next call
- Currying Does not preset any argument, it receive each argument one at a time
- Both of them are specialization technic, but they specialze in a different way

- REFER - https://bjouhier.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/currying-the-callback-or-the-essence-of-futures/

Composition
- When one Function call is Producing an Output that is then later routed to Another function call
- Taking the OUTPUT of one function, making it the input of another
- It is often the case that it will end up in some kind of Variable passed to another function, Thats Composition
- Composition GOES from RIGHT TO LEFT (LEFT <==== RIGHT)
- Composition is a Declarative Flow
- A Series of State Transition Managed Data Flow


Piping (Pipe)
- Piping GOES from LEFT TO RIGHT (LEFT ===+> RIGHT)


Immutability
- Immutability Means that the change that needs to Occur, should ne Intentional. It should not be ACCIDENTAL.
- Change Should not be happening without us being unware
- Immutability is the concept of how we control MUTATION
- CONST is a semantic Placeholder for a Literal Value and denotes the should be IMMUTABLE


Assignment Immutability (By Value - PRIMITIVES)
- Use CONST to stop value being mutated
- CONST cannot be Re-assigned or MUTATED
- CONST word seems to be confusing hence it is Depricated in JAVA, and they created a FINAL to avoid confusion
- When People see CONST the first thought comes is the value does not change, which is NOT TRUE
- CONST just cannot be RE-ASSIGNED OR MUTATED (Only if Primitive, We can change an Object Value)
- CONST/LET are usually BLOCK SCOPED (10-15 lines of block code), hence people should not be worried about the Reassingment of CONST type

Value Immutability (By Reference - Objects)
- As stated earlier, CONST only disallows the Assignments/Mutation of PRIMITIVE TYPES
- But for OBJECTS, if you want to make Object Read Only and disallow any modification, use OBJECT.FREEZE on the OBJECT
- A Note- Even with Object.Freeze - Nested Object properties still can be modified 
- Always Assume the object you receive in a Function is Read ONLY Data Structure(Don't Modify the original Object)
- Don't Mutate, just Copy

Immutable DataStructure (By Reference - Deep/Nested Objects)
- Treat All Data Structure as Read-Only whether they are or not
- You could use "immutable.js" to achieve Immutability of PRIMITIVES/OBJECTS/DATA STRUCTURE Types

3 Ways to Resolve Immutability PROBLEM
- At the callsite, when you pass any Object, you should annotate that with "Object.Freeze"
- Always Treat received Data Structure (DS) in Function READ-ONLY
- Use Third Party Library such as "Immutable.js" to Track "Assignment Mutability (By Value)", "Value Mutability (By Reference)", and "Immutable Datastructure (DS)"



Recursion
- Significant and Important Solution to the Multiple Problems - WHERE TO STOP
- Every Recursion should have A BASE CONDITION (WHERE TO STOP)
- Recursion Makes your Code More Declarative
- Divide and Conquer Types of Problems are a Perfect fit for Recursion
- Use of PROPER TAIL CALLS can resolve Massive Memory Usage and Running out of STACK FRAMES Error
- Tail Calls - Passing Results to Recursive Function Everytime it is called
- Also Termed as CONTINUATION PASSING STYLE 


Functor
- A function Programming TERM
- Operation on a Collection of VALUES
- A Functor is a value (a Collection of Values) over which these values in it can be mapped
- It is Essentially a VALUE that you can map an Operation 
- Functors are Containers that can be used with a 'map' Function
- A Functor is simply something that can be MAPPED OVER (Mappable)
- A Functor is something that is MAPPABLE or Something that can be MAPPED between Objects in a Category
- Example: MAP, REDUCE, FILTER - [1,2,3].map(x=>x*2)
- An Array is MAPPABLE, so it is Functor
- To Create any Object a Functor, you need to provide a map() function to that
- REFER - https://ruairidh.dev/what-the-functor/#:~:text=TL%3BDR%2C%20it's%20an%20object,are%20strong%20similarities%20with%20Array.

Monad
- A Monad is BOTH Mappable and Flat-mappable
- Monad is a combination of Functor + Function Composition
- Monad is Anything which is Mapped and FlatMapped
- Monad is a way of creating a Functional Programming friendly Data Structure
- Monad is a design pattern used to describe computations as a series of steps. 
- They are extensively used in pure functional programming languages to manage side effects 
- But can also be used in multiparadigm languages to control complexity.
- Monads wrap types giving them additional behavior like the automatic propagation of empty value (Maybe monad) 
- OR simplifying asynchronous code (Continuation monad).
- A way of Pairing Data with a Set of Predictable Behaviour that let it interact with other data + behaviour pairing
- Identity Monad - const Identity = (x) => ({chain: f => f(x), emit: () => x, map: f => Identity(f(x)), inspect: () => `Identity(${x})`});
- The identity monad is the simplest monad. It just wraps a value. The Identity constructor will serve as the unit function.
- Maybe Monad - May be there is a value OR May be there is not - To Handle UNDEFINED and NULL values 
- The maybe monad is similar to the identity monad but besides storing a value it can also represent the absence of any value.
- The list monad represents a lazily computed list of values.
- The continuation monad is used for asynchronous tasks. Fortunately with ES6 there is no need to implement it 
— The Promise object is an implementation of a monad.
// Promise.resolve(value) will serve as the Unit function
// Promise.prototype.then will serve as the Bind function

In functional programming, a monad is a kind of abstract data type used to represent computations (instead of data in the domain model). Monads allow the programmer to chain actions together to build a pipeline, in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad.



To be considered a monad the structure has to provide three components:

Type constructor:
 — a feature that creates a monadic type for the underlying type. For example it defines the type Maybe<number> for the underlying type number.
The UNIT function:
 - that wraps a value of underlying type into a monad. For the Maybe monad it wraps value 2 of the type number into the value Maybe(2) of the type Maybe<number>.
The BIND function: 
 - that chains the operations on a monadic values. More - https://curiosity-driven.org/monads-in-javascript
